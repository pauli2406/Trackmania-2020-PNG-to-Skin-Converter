# Trackmania 2020 PNG to Skin Converter

Hey guys,

I made a small tool which automatically turns the exported .png's to the requiered .dds files. 
The files then get zipped up and put in your TM Skin folder. 

You just need to run the program and put in the name of you skin. 
No need to use Paint.net to export 24 files individually. 

The program is based on Python, so you'd need to [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it before. 
Make sure to tick the checkbox to add it to your Path an the beginning of your installation. 

Just download the zip here <link>, unpack it to your preferred directory and start the .bat file.
In some situation Windows will warn you, if you trust me :) just execute anyway. You can always look into the code before executing.

## Requirements
- OS: Windows 10
- Python 3.8.5 https://www.python.org/downloads/ and add it to your path. Check if you can execute "python --version"
